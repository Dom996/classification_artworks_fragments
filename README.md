# classification_artworks_fragments
This repository includes a Computer Vision project developed in a university course.
This project aims to take an artwork from an artistic period and fragment the artwork in two ways. 
The first way is making randomly and the second way is making the fragmentation of the artworks in a way conscious.
After this two-step, I used various ML models can permitted me to classify a single fragment into a specific artistic period.
